# Plan for Adding New Use Cases

## 1. PG&E Wildfire Prevention Use Case (Energy Vertical)

### Use Case Details
- **Name**: Wildfire Prevention & Infrastructure Risk
- **ID**: wildfire-prevention
- **Description**: AI-driven infrastructure monitoring and risk assessment to prevent catastrophic wildfires
- **Icon**: AlertTriangle

### Executive Summary Structure
Based on the PG&E document, the executive summary should include:

**Pain Points:**
- Aging infrastructure requiring risk prioritization for repairs
- Lack of cross-validation between asset risk, weather data, and maintenance schedules
- No escalation or override logic when risk thresholds are breached
- Absence of audit trails on AI decisions
- Legal exposure due to failure to act on data ($13.5B in settlements)

**Business Case:**
- Prevent catastrophic losses (PG&E paid $13.5B in damages)
- Maintain operational continuity (avoid bankruptcy)
- Preserve governance confidence and regulatory standing
- Protect human lives and property (85 deaths in Camp Fire)

**Technical Case:**
- Integrity Layer for cross-domain data validation
- Accuracy Layer for real-time risk assessment override
- Controls Layer for immediate shutdown triggers
- Full audit trail with timestamped logic chains
- Inspector Module for compliance evidence

**Key Benefits:**
- 100% prevention of AI-blind infrastructure failures
- Real-time correlation of weather, asset, and maintenance data
- Automated escalation and human-in-the-loop controls
- Complete traceability for regulatory compliance
- Reduced liability through governed AI decisions

- PG&E (as the cautionary example)
- Southern California Edison
- Duke Energy
- Dominion Energy

## 2. Zillow AI Pricing Governance Use Case (Real Estate Vertical)

### Use Case Details
- **Name**: AI Pricing Governance
- **ID**: ai-pricing-governance
- **Description**: Governed AI for real estate valuation and automated buying decisions
- **Icon**: Home

### Executive Summary Structure
Based on the Zillow document, the executive summary should include:

**Pain Points:**
- Model overconfidence leading to overestimated home values
- Lack of volatility controls in rapidly changing markets
- Blind scaling to new markets without validation
- No human-in-the-loop for high-impact decisions
- Opaque AI reasoning without explainability
- $1.5 billion loss and 2,000+ layoffs

**Business Case:**
- Prevent catastrophic financial losses (Zillow lost $1.5B)
- Protect workforce stability (avoid mass layoffs)
- Maintain market integrity (prevent artificial price distortions)
- Preserve strategic AI initiatives
- Build stakeholder trust through transparency

**Technical Case:**
- Accuracy Vanguard for confidence scoring and drift detection
- Integrity Vanguard for fairness and policy alignment
- Security Vanguard for role-based access control
- Human-in-the-loop engine for critical decisions
- Scenario simulator for market validation

**Key Benefits:**
- 85% confidence threshold enforcement on all predictions
- Real-time volatility detection and market adaptation
- Sandbox validation before market expansion
- Complete audit trails for every pricing decision
- Emergency halt capabilities for flawed logic

## 3. Real Estate Vertical Structure

Since this is a new vertical, we need to create:

### Vertical Configuration
```typescript
{
  id: 'real-estate',
  name: 'Real Estate',
  description: 'AI solutions for property valuation, market analysis, and transaction automation',
  icon: Home,
  color: 'from-amber-500 to-orange-600',
  useCases: [
    {
      id: 'ai-pricing-governance',
      name: 'AI Pricing Governance',
      description: 'Governed AI for real estate valuation and automated buying decisions',
      icon: Home,
      metrics: {
        accuracy: '94%',
        efficiency: '+85%',
        cost: '-75%',
        compliance: '100%'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update verticals.ts**:
   - Add Real Estate vertical configuration
   - Add Wildfire Prevention use case to Energy vertical
   - Add AI Pricing Governance use case to Real Estate vertical

2. **Create Executive Summaries**:
   - Write comprehensive summaries following the gold standard format
   - Include specific metrics and ROI calculations
   - Reference the companies mentioned in the documents

3. **Create Dashboard Components**:
   - WildfirePreventionDashboard.tsx
   - AIPricingGovernanceDashboard.tsx
   - Follow the pattern of OilfieldLandLeaseDashboard with use-case-specific visualizations

4. **Update Routing**:
   - Add routes for new dashboards
   - Integrate with UseCaseDashboard.tsx
