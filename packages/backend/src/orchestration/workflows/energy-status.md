## Additional Workflows
- **renewable-energy-integration** - Additional workflow for renewable energy integration
- **energy-trading-optimization** - Additional workflow for energy trading

## Notes
- All 14 Energy use cases from MissionControlV2 are now fully implemented
- 2 additional Energy workflows were found in energy-extended.ts that provide extra functionality
- Total of 16 Energy workflows are available in the system
- All workflows follow the standard 6-step pattern: detect → analyze → decide → execute → verify → report
