# Integration Test Summary & Recovery Guide

## Quick Start Commands

After your computer crashed during the E2E tests, here are the commands to run the tests again:

### 1. Navigate to Backend Directory
```bash
cd packages/backend
```

### 2. Ensure Dependencies are Installed
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run Individual Tests (Recommended First)

```bash
# Test 1: Insurance Risk Assessment (438 lines)
npm test -- src/tests/e2e/insurance-risk-assessment-workflow.test.ts

# Test 2: Methane Detection (192 lines)
npm test -- src/tests/e2e/methane-detection-workflow.test.ts

# Test 3: Oilfield Lease (510 lines)
npm test -- src/tests/e2e/oilfield-lease-workflow.test.ts

# Test 4: PHMSA Compliance (602 lines)
npm test -- src/tests/e2e/phmsa-compliance-workflow.test.ts
```

### 4. Run All E2E Tests Together
```bash
npm test -- src/tests/e2e/
```

### 5. Run with Coverage Report
```bash
npm test -- --coverage src/tests/e2e/
```

## Windows Batch Script for Automated Testing

Save this as `run-integration-tests.bat` in the `packages/backend` directory:

```batch
@echo off
echo Starting Integration Test Suite...
echo ================================

set TESTS=insurance-risk-assessment-workflow.test.ts methane-detection-workflow.test.ts oilfield-lease-workflow.test.ts phmsa-compliance-workflow.test.ts

for %%t in (%TESTS%) do (
    echo.
    echo Running: %%t
    echo ------------------------
    
    call npm test -- src/tests/e2e/%%t
    
    if errorlevel 1 (
        echo [FAILED] %%t
        echo Stopping test execution...
        exit /b 1
    ) else (
        echo [PASSED] %%t
    )
)

echo.
echo ================================
echo All integration tests completed!
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If Tests Fail with Memory Issues
```bash
# Increase Node.js memory allocation
set NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096
npm test -- src/tests/e2e/
```

### If Tests Hang or Timeout
```bash
# Run with timeout detection
npm test -- --detectOpenHandles src/tests/e2e/
```

### If You Need Detailed Logs
```bash
# Enable debug logging
set DEBUG=*
npm test -- --verbose src/tests/e2e/
```

## Important Notes

1. **No External Dependencies Required**: All services (Firebase, Redis, etc.) are mocked
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test file can run independently
3. **Execution Time**: Full suite takes approximately 5-10 minutes
4. **Resource Usage**: Tests are CPU-intensive but shouldn't require excessive memory

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Review Test Results**: Check for any failed tests or warnings
2. **Generate Coverage Report**: Ensure adequate code coverage
3. **Check for Memory Leaks**: Use `--detectOpenHandles` if tests seem slow
4. **Document Any Issues**: Note any tests that consistently fail or cause problems

## Recovery Status Checklist

- [ ] Dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] Individual tests run successfully
- [ ] All tests run together successfully
- [ ] Coverage report generated
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Test results documented
