## Data Flow

### Data Flow Service (`dataFlow.service.ts`)

The platform uses a centralized data flow service to ensure seamless data movement between components:

```typescript
// Initialize workflow with data
dataFlowService.initializeWorkflow(workflowId, useCaseId, ingestedData, agents);

// Update workflow status
dataFlowService.updateWorkflowStatus(workflowId, 'running', 50);

// Record agent activities
dataFlowService.recordAgentActivity(workflowId, agentId, activity);

// Complete workflow with certification
dataFlowService.completeWorkflow(workflowId, results, 'certified');
```

### Data Flow Sequence

1. **Data Ingestion** → Stored in `IngestedData` object
2. **Workflow Initialization** → Creates `WorkflowData` with ingested data
3. **Agent Deployment** → Updates workflow status to 'deploying'
4. **Agent Processing** → Records activities and updates progress
5. **Workflow Completion** → Generates certification results
6. **Data Persistence** → Stores in localStorage for retrieval

## Feature Guide

### Launching an Oilfield Land Lease Mission

1. **Navigate to Mission Control Enhanced**
   - Click "Mission Control" in the navigation menu

2. **Select Oilfield Land Lease**
   - Filter by "Energy" vertical (optional)
   - Find "Oilfield Land Lease" card
   - Click "Upload Data" button

3. **Upload Your Data**
   - Drag and drop a CSV file with lease data
   - Preview the data to ensure correctness
   - File should contain columns like: lease_id, location, royalty_rate, etc.

4. **Launch the Mission**
   - Click "Launch Mission" button
   - System auto-configures 6 specialized agents:
     - Oilfield Lease Orchestrator
     - Data Ingestion Agent
     - Data Transformation Agent
     - Analytics Agent
     - Compliance Validator
     - Report Generator

5. **Monitor Progress**
   - Automatically redirected to Mission Operations Center
   - Watch agents deploy sequentially
   - View real-time processing activities
   - Access Oilfield analytics dashboard tabs:
     - Overview: Key metrics and distributions
     - Financial: Revenue analysis and projections
     - Risk: Risk assessment and mitigation
     - Operations: Lease details and production

6. **Review Certifications**
   - Certifications appear after ~10 seconds
   - View data quality scores
   - Check compliance status
   - Generate audit reports

### Using the Agent Configuration Service

The platform includes pre-configured agent setups for each use case:

```typescript
// Get configuration for a use case
const config = agentConfigurationService.getConfiguration('oilfield-land-lease');

// Configuration includes:
- Specialized agents with roles
- Workflow steps
- Processing parameters
- Integration settings
```

### Monitoring Real-time Updates

Components subscribe to data flow events:

```typescript
// Subscribe to workflow updates
const unsubscribe = dataFlowService.subscribe(workflowId, (event) => {
  console.log('Event:', event.type, event.data);
});

// Event types:
- data_ingested
- workflow_started
- agent_deployed
- agent_activity
- workflow_completed
- certification_generated
```
