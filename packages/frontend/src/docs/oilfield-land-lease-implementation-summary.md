- Extended `AgentNode` type to support new agent types: data, analytics, compliance, report
- Pre-configured 6 specialized agents for Oilfield Land Lease:
  - Oilfield Lease Orchestrator (coordinator)
  - Data Ingestion Agent
  - Data Transformation Agent
  - Analytics Agent
  - Compliance Validator
  - Report Generator
- Updated `usecase.service.ts` to use agent configuration service
- Added visual indicator in Mission Control showing auto-configured agents

**Key Features**:
- Automatic agent selection based on use case type
- Pre-defined agent connections and data flow
- Agent capabilities and configuration metadata
- Validation for agent configurations

### 3. âœ… Dynamic Workflow Generation
**Location**: Active Missions & Operations section

**Implementation**:
- Created `WorkflowGenerator.tsx` component
- Automatically generates workflow steps based on agent configuration
- Visual workflow preview with step-by-step display
- Estimated execution time calculation
- One-click workflow save functionality

**Key Features**:
- Dynamic step generation from agent graph
- Step configuration based on agent type and use case
- Collapsible workflow preview
- Integration with existing workflow system

## Enhanced User Flow

### Before Enhancements:
1. Navigate to Use Cases (1 click)
2. Select Oilfield Land Lease (1 click)
3. Navigate to Agents (1 click)
4. Manually configure agents (multiple clicks)
5. Navigate to Workflows (1 click)
6. Create workflow manually (multiple clicks)
7. Run workflow (1 click)
8. Nothing happens except success toast

**Total: 6+ navigation steps, manual configuration required**

### After Enhancements:
1. Navigate to Mission Control Enhanced (1 click)
2. Select Oilfield Land Lease use case
3. Upload data file (drag-and-drop)
4. Click "Launch Mission" (1 click)
   - Agents auto-configured
   - Workflow auto-generated
   - Execution starts automatically
5. Redirected to Mission Operations Center

**Total: 2 navigation steps, fully automated**

## Technical Architecture

### New Services:
- **agentConfiguration.service.ts**: Manages pre-configured agent setups
- **Enhanced agentExecution.service.ts**: Handles workflow execution with data context

### New Components:
- **DataIngestion.tsx**: File upload and data preview
- **WorkflowGenerator.tsx**: Dynamic workflow creation

### Type Extensions:
- Extended `AgentNode` type with new agent types and capabilities
- Added support for data ingestion metadata

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: User uploads CSV file â†’ Data parsed and previewed â†’ Stored in context
2. **Agent Configuration**: Use case selected â†’ Agents auto-configured from service â†’ Visual confirmation
3. **Workflow Generation**: Agent graph analyzed â†’ Steps generated â†’ Workflow created
4. **Execution**: Workflow started â†’ Agents process data â†’ Results displayed in Mission Operations Center

## Benefits

### For Demo Experience:
- **Reduced Complexity**: From 6+ clicks to 2 clicks
- **Automated Setup**: No manual agent or workflow configuration needed
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators at each step
- **Real Data Processing**: Actual file upload and processing

### For Development:
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add new use cases
- **Reusable Components**: Data ingestion and workflow generation can be used elsewhere
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with extended types
- **Service-Based**: Clean separation of concerns
