# Global Context Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced UseCaseContext
- Added `launchUseCase` method that automatically triggers workflows and deployment
- Added `resetContext` method to clear active use case and return to baseline
- Added baseline dummy data structure for when no use case is active
- Added `isLaunching` and `isDeploying` states for better UX

### 2. Use Case Launcher Updates
- Integrated with global context to launch use cases with one click
- Added loading states during launch process
- Automatic redirect to Workflows page after successful launch
- No more manual workflow triggering required

### 3. Mission Control (Dashboard) Updates
- Added reset button that only appears when a use case is active
- Dashboard now shows active use case name
- Data automatically switches between baseline and use case-specific data
- All metrics update based on active context

### 4. Workflows Page Updates
- Removed manual use case selection dropdown
- Page now reacts to global context automatically
- Shows empty state when no use case is active
- Directs users to Use Case Launcher when needed

### 5. Backend API Endpoints
- `/api/usecases/default/data` - Returns baseline dummy data
- `/api/usecases/:id/data` - Returns use case specific data (existing)
- `/api/usecases/:id/runWorkflows` - Triggers workflow execution
- `/api/usecases/:id/deploy` - Initiates agent deployment
- `/api/usecases/:id/status` - Checks execution status

## How It Works

1. **Initial State**: Platform shows baseline dummy data in Mission Control
2. **Launch Use Case**: User selects and launches a use case in the Launcher
3. **Automatic Actions**:
   - Sets `activeUseCaseId` globally
   - Triggers workflows automatically
   - Deploys agents automatically
   - Loads unified data for the use case
   - Redirects to Workflows page
4. **All Tabs Update**: Every tab automatically shows data for the active use case
5. **Reset**: User can click "Reset Use Case" in Mission Control to return to baseline

## Benefits

1. **Simplified UX**: One-click use case activation
2. **Consistent Data**: All tabs show the same use case data
3. **Automatic Flow**: No manual workflow triggering
4. **Clear State**: Easy reset to baseline
5. **Persistent**: Survives page refresh via localStorage

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation across all tabs, apply the same pattern used in Workflows to:
- Agent Orchestration
- Operations
- Integration Log
- Audit Console
- Output Viewer
- Certifications

Each tab should:
1. Import and use `useUseCaseContext`
2. Remove any manual use case selection
3. React to `activeUseCaseId` and `activeUseCaseData`
4. Show empty state when no use case is active
5. Direct users to Use Case Launcher when needed

## Testing the Flow

1. Navigate to Use Case Launcher
2. Select "Oilfield Land Lease" and click Launch
3. Observe automatic workflow triggering and redirect
4. Check that all tabs show Oilfield data
5. Click "Reset Use Case" in Mission Control
6. Verify return to baseline data
