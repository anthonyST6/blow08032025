# VS Code Debug Configuration - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary
You're experiencing a permission error when VS Code tries to create the `.vscode` folder and `launch.json` file:
```
EPERM: operation not permitted, mkdir 'c:\Users\antho\Seraphim Vanguards Kilo Dev\.vscode'
```

## Files Created for You

I've created the following files in the `packages` directory:

1. **vscode-launch.json** - Debug configurations with Chrome auto-launch
2. **vscode-tasks.json** - Tasks for automatic dev server management
3. **setup-vscode-admin.bat** - Batch file for automated setup
4. **setup-vscode-simple.ps1** - PowerShell script for setup
5. **VSCODE_DEBUG_SETUP.md** - Detailed documentation

## Quick Solution Steps

### Option 1: Run the Batch File as Administrator (Easiest)

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to `C:\Users\antho\Seraphim Vanguards Kilo Dev\packages`
3. Right-click on `setup-vscode-admin.bat`
4. Select "Run as administrator"
5. Follow the prompts

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Create the .vscode folder manually:**
   - Open File Explorer as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator)
   - Navigate to `C:\Users\antho\Seraphim Vanguards Kilo Dev`
   - Create a new folder named `.vscode`

2. **Copy the configuration files:**
   - Copy `packages\vscode-launch.json` → `.vscode\launch.json`
   - Copy `packages\vscode-tasks.json` → `.vscode\tasks.json`

### Option 3: Run VS Code as Administrator

1. Close VS Code completely
2. Right-click VS Code shortcut
3. Select "Run as administrator"
4. Open your project
5. Press F5 - VS Code should now be able to create the .vscode folder

## Using the Debug Configuration

Once the files are in place:

1. **Start debugging with auto-launch:**
   - Press `F5` or open Run and Debug panel (`Ctrl+Shift+D`)
   - Select "Launch Chrome with Auto Start" from dropdown
   - Click the green play button
   - This will:
     - Start your dev server automatically
     - Launch Chrome
     - Connect the debugger
     - Stop the server when you stop debugging

2. **Alternative configurations:**
   - "Launch Chrome (Server Already Running)" - Use if dev server is already running
   - "Debug Backend" - For Node.js backend debugging
   - "Full Stack Debug with Auto Start" - Debug both frontend and backend

## Features Included

- ✅ Automatic dev server startup
- ✅ Chrome browser auto-launch
- ✅ Source map support for TypeScript/React
- ✅ Vite path alias support (`@/*` mappings)
- ✅ Automatic server shutdown on debug stop
- ✅ Separate Chrome profile to avoid conflicts
- ✅ Full stack debugging capability

## Troubleshooting

### If Permission Errors Persist:

1. **Check Windows Security:**
   - Right-click the project folder
   - Properties → Security tab
   - Ensure your user has "Full control"

2. **Antivirus/Windows Defender:**
   - Add VS Code to exceptions
   - Temporarily disable to test

3. **Alternative Location:**
   - Create `.vscode` inside `packages\frontend\`
   - Adjust paths in launch.json accordingly

### If Chrome Doesn't Launch:

1. Ensure Chrome is installed
2. Try changing `"type": "chrome"` to `"type": "edge"` for Microsoft Edge
3. Check if port 3000 is available

## Command Summary

```bash
# Navigate to packages directory
cd "C:\Users\antho\Seraphim Vanguards Kilo Dev\packages"

# Run the setup (choose one):
# Option 1: Batch file (right-click → Run as administrator)
setup-vscode-admin.bat

# Option 2: PowerShell (run PowerShell as Administrator first)
.\setup-vscode-simple.ps1

# Option 3: Manual copy commands (in admin command prompt)
mkdir "C:\Users\antho\Seraphim Vanguards Kilo Dev\.vscode"
copy vscode-launch.json "C:\Users\antho\Seraphim Vanguards Kilo Dev\.vscode\launch.json"
copy vscode-tasks.json "C:\Users\antho\Seraphim Vanguards Kilo Dev\.vscode\tasks.json"
```

## Next Steps

1. Use one of the methods above to create the .vscode folder and copy the files
2. Restart VS Code (preferably as administrator if issues persist)
3. Press F5 to start debugging with Chrome auto-launch
4. Set breakpoints in your TypeScript/React code
5. Enjoy debugging!

The configuration is specifically tailored for your Vite + React + TypeScript monorepo setup.
