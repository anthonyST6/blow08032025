# Seraphim Vanguards v2.0 - Architectural Summary & Next Steps

## Executive Overview

The Seraphim Vanguards platform is being transformed from a general AI governance system into a **vertical-specific, use-case-driven platform** with advanced agent orchestration capabilities. This upgrade introduces:

- **5 Industry Verticals**: Energy, Government, Insurance, Finance, Healthcare
- **Vanguard Architecture**: Security Sentinel (Blue), Integrity Auditor (Red), Accuracy Engine (Green)
- **Agent Orchestration**: Prompt → Router → Binder → Domain Agent → Vanguards → Report
- **3 Initial Use Cases**: Energy O&G Land Lease, Government LED, Insurance Continental

## Key Architectural Components

### 1. The Vanguard Loop
```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Security        │     │ Integrity        │     │ Accuracy        │
│ Sentinel        │ --> │ Auditor          │ --> │ Engine          │
│ (Blue #3A88F5)  │     │ (Red #DC3E40)    │     │ (Green #3BD16F) │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

### 2. Agent Orchestration Flow
```
User Prompt → Prompt Router → Use Case Binder → Domain Agent
                                                      ↓
Report Builder ← Accuracy Engine ← Integrity Auditor ← Security Sentinel
